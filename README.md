This repository contains projects I worked on under Yandex Praktikum Data Science 8 month program.

While working on projects I studied and used Python for data analysis (Pandas, Numpy), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), and building machine learning (scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost).

In addition to this I also learned how to present and communicate critical findings with the team, work with unstructured data such as texts and pictures, fetch data with SQL queries and do statistical hypothesis testing using statistical tests and bootstrapping.
