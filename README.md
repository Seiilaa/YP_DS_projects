This repository contains projects I worked on under Yandex Praktikum Data Science 8 month program.

While working on projects I studied and used Python for data analysis (Pandas, Numpy), data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly), and building machine learning (scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn, CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost).

In addition to this I also learned how to present and communicate critical findings with the team, work with unstructured data such as texts and pictures, fetch data with SQL queries and do statistical hypothesis testing using statistical tests and bootstrapping.


| Project name | Description | Libraries | 
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- |
| [Selection of a region for oil production](Selection%20of%20a%20region%20for%20oil%20production) | Selection of the best oil production region by comparing potential profits and risks using linear regression and the bootstrap method| *pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn seaborn*
| [Taxi peak load prediction](Taxi%20peak%20load%20prediction) | Predict the maximum number of taxi orders in the next hour for a taxi operator using lightgbm and time series feature enginering| *pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn statsmodels lightgbm*
| [Telecom customer churn prediction](Telecom%20customer%20churn%20prediction) | Built an ML model that predicts customer churn for a telecom company. A complete machine learning model building pipeline from data cleansing to model performance comparison | *pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn sklearn statsmodels catboost*
| [Model prototype for heavy industry](Heavy%20industry%20model%20prototype) | Built a prototype model for a company that develops solutions for the efficient operation for the gold mining industry that predicts the recovery factor of gold from gold-bearing ore. This model will be used to help optimize production and avoid launching enterprises with unprofitable characteristics. | *pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn*
| [Text sentiment recognition with BERT](bert_tweet_sentiment) | Using BERT tokenized and created embeddings of 160 000 tweets to train and compare models that classify tweets as toxic or not. | *pandas numpy tensorflow transformers pytorch sklearn xgboost* 
|[Video game market analysis](Video%20game%20market%20analysis) | Analysis of a video game market historical data to identify patterns that determine success of the game | *pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy*
| [Airplane flights demand analysis](Airplane%20flights%20demand%20analysis) | Analysis of the airplane flight data in Russia in 2018. Some Plotly charts building practice | *pandas plotly*
| [Borrowers reliability research](borrowers_realibility_research) | Preprocessed and analyzed the "dirty" data of the clients provided by the credit department of the bank. Using the data I identified what features can be used as signals identifying the risk level of the client. Using pymystem I extracted features from text features and identified most popular reasons why people take credit.| *pandas, pymystem3*
